# Displacement Camp Sanitation Crisis

A large refugee camp near the Myanmar-Thailand border now houses over 5,000 displaced individuals. However, the camp lacks sufficient clean water, waste disposal, and hygiene facilities, raising fears of waterborne disease outbreaks.

**Impacts:**
- Risk of cholera and dysentery
- Overwhelmed relief organizations
- Urgent need for sanitation infrastructure
