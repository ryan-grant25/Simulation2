# Hospital Overcrowding in Chiang Rai

Local hospitals in Chiang Rai are struggling to manage the influx of injured people from surrounding quake-affected regions. With limited ICU beds, surgical teams, and trauma supplies, doctors are forced to triage patients and delay non-life-threatening care.

**Impacts:**
- Emergency room overcapacity
- Shortages of critical medical equipment
- Delayed treatment for non-critical injuries
