Thailand's national aid coordination portal was disabled in a phishing attack suspected to be linked to organized crime or hostile foreign actors. The attack has caused miscommunication and delays in international aid distribution.

**Impacts:**
- Delay in relief logistics
- Data breach of volunteer and donor records
- Increased cyber monitoring required
