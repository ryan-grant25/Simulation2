# Bridge Collapse in Mandalay

A major highway bridge near Mandalay collapsed due to the 7.7 magnitude earthquake, cutting off a critical supply route for aid and emergency response. This disruption has delayed the delivery of food, clean water, and medical supplies to rural communities. The collapse also highlights the region's vulnerability due to aging infrastructure and lack of seismic reinforcements.

**Impacts:**
- Isolated villages cut off from assistance
- Delays in emergency medical transport
- Risk of further collapses from aftershocks
