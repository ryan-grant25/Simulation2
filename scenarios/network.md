# Network Failure in Rural Sagaing

Telecommunication infrastructure in rural Sagaing was destroyed, cutting off thousands from emergency services. Villages are now relying on satellite radios and drones for external contact and supply drops.

**Impacts:**
- Complete communication blackout
- Delayed rescue and coordination
- Dependency on foreign tech aid
