The recent earthquakes in Myanmar and Thailand have led to devastating casualties. The death toll in Myanmar has climbed to 2,056, over 3,900 injured, and 270 missing, according to the Myanmar Military Junta (Osborne, Mark, et al.). The epicenter of the earthquake was located 1 miles north-west of the town of Sagaing. There were multiple rounds of earthquakes, with the first one striking at 12:50 (6:20 GMT) with a 7.7 magnitude. Then a second earthquake struck about 12 minutes later south of Sagaing.  Ongoing aftershocks continue to hamper rescue efforts, exacerbating the crisis. Beyond the immediate destruction and loss of life, the earthquakes have severely disrupted infrastructure, displaced thousands, and strained emergency response systems, requiring urgent intervention from both national and international stakeholders.

While the crisis originates from an environmental disaster,  its repercussions span human security (casualties, displacement) and economic stability (damaged infrastructure, disrupted trade). This simulation will spark multiple events in reaction to the earthquake. Emergency response, construction based companies, government policies, local and federal levels of police and first responders. The earthquake leaves the area extremely vulnerable to physical and cyber attacks, which complicates the situation. By incorporating these multilayered threats, the exercise aims to prepare responders for the complex realities of post-disaster security and stability.
