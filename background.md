In late March 2025, a powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake hit near the town of Sagaing in Myanmar. Just minutes later, another large quake followed, shaking areas in both Myanmar and Thailand. These back-to-back disasters caused massive destruction—thousands were killed or injured, buildings collapsed, and essential services were disrupted. Ongoing aftershocks have made it even harder for rescue teams to work safely, and many communities are still without stable housing, water, or electricity.

Responding to the crisis has been especially difficult due to the political situation in the region. Myanmar’s military-led government has made it harder for outside aid to get in, while Thailand has been more active in coordinating relief and support. Even though Thailand is more prepared in terms of emergency response, both countries are struggling to manage the damage in more remote areas. The situation has also brought attention to how unprepared many buildings and communities still are when it comes to earthquakes.

Adding to the complexity, there have also been cybersecurity concerns in the aftermath. Hackers have taken advantage of the chaos by trying to disrupt emergency services and spread misinformation online. These kinds of attacks show how disaster response today isn’t just about physical recovery—it also includes protecting digital systems and communication. This simulation will give participants a chance to step into the shoes of decision-makers and think through how to respond to a crisis like this from all angles.
